@par Example Description

 This example provides a description of how to configure DMA2D peripheral in 
 Register_to_Memory transfer mode and display the result on LCD.
 
 The Register_to_Memory transfer mode, is used to fill a user defined area by a 
 fixed color.
 
  After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed and then the LCD is 
  configured to display color zone created after this transfer on LCD. 
  (more details about LCD configuration in LCD examples)

  @note 
  => Output offset is the number of pixel to be skipped after each transferred line
                      
  how to calculate the size of the transferred data ? 
  => selected color mode gives the number of bits per pixel and we have 
     (ARGB4444 => 16bits/pixel) the number of pixel per line and the number of line, 
     therefore :
    
     data_size = (bits per pixel) X (pixel per line + output offset) X (number of line)

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on and STM32F429xx/439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL 
    (STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Select "STM32F429_439xx" workspace related to the used device and Add 
    the following files in the project source list :
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_lcd.c 
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_sdram.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_ioe8.c
